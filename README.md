snaptime
============
SnapTime is a generalizable pipeline for processing and querying asynchronous extremely large time-stamped datasets in parallel.SnapTime accepts a customizable schema for the file and directory structure. It then creates a compressed directory structure that allowed us to quickly query for records (based on attributes) without loading the whole time series into memory. Finally, SnapTime has a query module that can slice the data and fill it if itâ€™s asynchronous. 


## INSTALLATION
To install SnapTime
In the same directory:
- clone the snap-dev-64 repository
    ```git clone https://github.com/snap-stanford/snap-dev-64.git```
